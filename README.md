base_project
============

This is a checkout template for Erlang applications, with rebar and plt stuff in place already a la Concrete, and some other customizations, like having my name already in place and always needing `proper` and so on.



How to shot web
---------------

To check out transparently over a repo, `git checkout-index -a -f --prefix=/c/projects/reponame/`.



Status
------

This is new, but derived from something mature (the concrete auto-project,) so this may be usable soon.

If you use this, you should probably fork it and re-customize it with your own data, instead of using it directly, so that you don't have to fix it every time you use it.
